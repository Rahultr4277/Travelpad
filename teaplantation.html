        <p>Tea or Chai is the most widely drunk beverage in the whole world. The tea plant, Camellia Sansis, is a
          cultivated variety of a tree that has its origins in an area between India and China. There are three main
          varieties of the tea plant - China, Assam, and Cambodia and a number of hybrids between the varieties. The
          China variety grows as high as nine feet (2.75 metres). It is a hardy plant able to withstand cold winters and
          has an economic life of at least 100 years. Munnar will welcome you with a carpet of tea bushes. The land
          where the three mountain streams Mudrapuzha, Nallathanni and Kundala meet is home to tea that is a blend of
          health and taste. The teas are cultivated in the undisturbed ecosystem of the Western Ghats. With some tea
          plantations at 2200 m above sea level, Munnar has some of the highest growing tea regions in the world. Tea
          gardens interspersed with fuel plantations and ‘Sholas’ are one of the unique features of this area. Munnar
          orthodox tea is known for its distinctive clean and medium toned fragrance of sweet biscuit in dip malt. The
          golden yellow brew with an orange depth is a combination of strength and briskness.The beauty of its pristine valleys, mountain,
          rivers and flora and fauna-rich mountains are fascinating.</p>
        <p>The Assam variety, a single-system tree ranging from 20 to 60 feet (6 to 18 metres) in height. Regular
          pruning keeps its height to a more manageable 4 to 5 feet tall. It has an economic life of 40 years with
          regular pruning and plucking. When grown at an altitude near that of Darjeeling (Assam) or Munnar (Kerala), it
          produces tea with fascinating flavours , sought after around the globe. The Cambodia variety, a single-system
          tree growing to about 16 feet (five metres) in height, is not cultivated but has been naturally crossed with
          other varieties.</p>

      <h3>HISTORY OF <span>TEA</span> IN MUNNAR</h3>
      <p>Once, long back in 1857, a British resident named John Daniel Munro came to Munnar. Interestingly, he came
        here, not to start any plantations but to settle the border dispute between Travancore and the nearby states of
        Munnar. Now, by seeing the beauty of Munnar, he got attracted or else we can say he fell for the beautiful
        Munnar. Seeing the hilly areas of Munnar, an idea hit into his mind. After all, he had an interest on
        plantations and now Munnar seemed to be the best place for that.

        Things were not so easy for him. Though Munnar was actually under the jurisdiction of Travancore, the place was
        the Jenmam land of Poonjar royal family. Daniel approached the Poonjar royal family to lend land for him. Daniel
        was accompanied by Kannan Thevar, the tribal chief of Anchunadu. At times Rohini Thirunal Kerala Varma Valiya
        Raja was the head of the royal family. Munro was successful in persuading the Raja.

        Naturally his eyes got hit on the Kannan Devan Hills. He realized it as the best place to start plantations. He
        bought the land from the royal family. In 1879, Munro formed North Travancore Land Planting & Agricultural
        Society. The society members started cultivation on coffee, cardamom, cinchona etc. Later all these crops were
        abandoned and they began to concentrate upon tea plantations. A W Turnor was the one who started plantation in
        Munnar.

        But it was neither Munro nor Turnor, who started tea cultivation in Munnar, but was A H Sharp, a European
        planter in 1880. He started tea cultivation in the 50 acres land at Parvathy. Now the land belongs to the Seven
        Mallay Estate. There was another setback in 1895, that Finley Muir and Company bought 33 estates in Munnar.
        These estates were later managed by Kannan Devan Hills Produce Company, which was formed in 1897.

        Now, in the year 1964 this Finley group collaborated with the Tata group to form Tata Finley group and Tata Tea
        Ltd was formed in 1983. It was in the year 2005 that Kannan Devan Hill Plantations Company Pvt Ltd was formed
        and Tata Tea transferred all its rights to the company. Thus started the grand history of tea in Munnar and
        today the company is the largest tea corporate in South India having an annual production of around 21 million
        kg of tea.

        Munnar is always synonymous to tea plantation. A trip to Munnar will be incomplete without having a visit to
        these tea plantations. Munnar is a place known for its beautiful tea estates and tea cultivation. No one will
        return home without tasting or shopping the tea essence of Munnar.

        Never miss to visit the Tea Museum at Munnar, while making a trip to Munnar. It is India's first ever tea
        museum, ideally placed at KDHP's (Kannan Devan Hill Plantation) Nallatanni Estate in Munnar. Here you can have a
        journey through the tea history of Munnar. Come and have a memorable trip to the tea valley of the Kashmir of
        South India...</p>
